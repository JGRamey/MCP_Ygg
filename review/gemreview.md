### `k8s/k8s-deployment.yaml.txt` Analysis

This file contains Kubernetes deployment configurations for the MCP Server. It defines various resources needed to deploy the application, including Namespaces, ConfigMaps, Secrets, PersistentVolumeClaims, Deployments, Services, Ingress, HorizontalPodAutoscalers, ServiceMonitors, PrometheusRules, NetworkPolicies, and PodDisruptionBudgets.

### Strengths

*   **Comprehensive Kubernetes Deployment:** This file provides a very comprehensive and well-structured set of Kubernetes manifests for deploying a complex application. It covers almost all aspects of a production-ready deployment.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Uses ConfigMaps for configuration, Secrets for sensitive data, and PersistentVolumeClaims for persistent storage, which are Kubernetes best practices.
*   **High Availability and Scalability:** Includes Deployments with multiple replicas, HorizontalPodAutoscalers (HPA) for automatic scaling based on CPU/memory, and PodDisruptionBudgets (PDB) for maintaining availability during voluntary disruptions.
*   **Observability:** Integrates with Prometheus and Grafana through `ServiceMonitor` and `PrometheusRule` for metrics collection and alerting.
*   **Security:** Implements `NetworkPolicy` for controlling network traffic between pods, enhancing security.
*   **Health Checks:** Defines `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, and `startupProbe` for robust health monitoring of pods.
*   **Init Containers:** Uses `initContainers` to ensure database services are ready before application pods start, preventing startup failures.

### Areas for Improvement & Recommendations

*   **File Extension:** The file has a `.txt` extension (`.yaml.txt`).
    *   **Recommendation:** Rename the file to `k8s-deployment.yaml` for proper YAML recognition and consistency.
*   **Hardcoded Passwords in Secrets:** While secrets are base64 encoded, the actual passwords ("neo4jpassword", "redispassword", "supersecretjwtkey") are hardcoded in the `data` section. This is a security risk as base64 is not encryption.
    *   **Recommendation:** **Do not commit actual secrets to version control.** Use a proper secret management solution (e.g., Sealed Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes External Secrets) to inject secrets into the cluster at deployment time. For development, use environment variables or a local `.env` file.
*   **`storageClassName`:** The `storageClassName` is set to "fast-ssd" and "standard". These are specific to the Kubernetes cluster environment.
    *   **Recommendation:** Document the expected `StorageClass` names or make them configurable if the deployment target varies.
*   **`image: mcp-server:latest`:** The application image uses the `latest` tag.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use specific image tags (e.g., `mcp-server:1.0.0`) for production deployments to ensure reproducibility and prevent unexpected updates.
*   **`NEO4J_AUTH` Value:** The `NEO4J_AUTH` environment variable is set to `neo4j/password`. While the password comes from a secret, the username "neo4j" is hardcoded.
    *   **Recommendation:** If the Neo4j username can change, it should also be sourced from a secret or ConfigMap.
*   **`redis-config` ConfigMap:** The Redis ConfigMap defines `maxmemory` and `maxmemory-policy`.
    *   **Recommendation:** Ensure these values are appropriate for the expected Redis workload and resource limits.
*   **`mcp-server-api` Readiness Probe:** The readiness probe for `mcp-server-api` is set to `/ready`, but the `api/fastapi_main.py` only defines `/health`.
    *   **Recommendation:** Ensure the FastAPI application has a `/ready` endpoint that accurately reflects its readiness to serve traffic, or update the probe path to `/health`.
*   **Worker Commands:** The worker deployments (`scraper-worker`, `processor-worker`) use hardcoded Python commands.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider using a more robust process manager within the container (e.g., Supervisor) or a custom entrypoint script to manage worker processes, especially if they are long-running or require specific startup sequences.
*   **Ingress Hostnames:** The Ingress rules use example hostnames (`api.mcp-server.example.com`, `dashboard.mcp-server.example.com`).
    *   **Recommendation:** These should be replaced with actual domain names for production deployment.
*   **Network Policy Egress Rules:** The egress rules are quite restrictive, allowing traffic only to specific database services and DNS. This is good for security but might need to be expanded if workers need to access external APIs (e.g., YouTube, web scraping targets).
    *   **Recommendation:** Review egress rules carefully to ensure all necessary external communication is allowed, while maintaining a strong security posture.
