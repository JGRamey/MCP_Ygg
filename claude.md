```

### **Efficient Workflow with Modular Files**
1. **Start**: Read `plan.md` for current priorities
2. **Deep Dive**: Open specific phase file for implementation details
3. **Reference**: Check `08_repository_structure.md` before creating files
4. **Track**: Update `09_implementation_status.md` after completing tasks
5. **Archive**: Move completed items to `p_completed.md`

---

## 🔄 MANDATORY SESSION WORKFLOW

### **Step 1: Project Analysis & Verification** 📊
```bash
# Read in this exact order:
1. claude.md          # Current context (this file)
2. plan.md           # Overview of all phases
3. updates/09_implementation_status.md # Current progress
4. updates/[current_phase].md # Full implementation details

# Verify implementation status:
- Check actual files exist for claimed completions
- Test imports and functionality
- Update percentages based on reality
```

### **Step 2: Task Planning** ✅
```python
# Create TODO list for session
TodoWrite([
    {"id": "fix_psutil_import", "status": "pending", "priority": "critical"},
    {"id": "implement_pip_tools", "status": "pending", "priority": "high"},
    {"id": "refactor_network_analyzer", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium"}
])
```

### **Step 3: Documentation** 📝
```bash
# Create session log
Path: /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/MCP_Ygg/chat_logs/
Format: YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_phase-X-task-description.md
```

### **Step 4: Duplicate Prevention** 🔍
```bash
# MANDATORY before creating ANY file
Grep pattern="[feature_name]" glob="**/*.py"
LS path="[target_directory]"

# If similar functionality exists:
- Enhance existing file
- Do NOT create duplicate
```

### **Step 5: Implementation** 🔨
- Follow phase-specific checklist from `updates/` files
- Update TODO status as you progress
- Test each component before marking complete
- Do not skip anything in the phase files from `updates/` - Don't be lazy, read the entire file

### **Step 6: Progress Update** 📈
- Update `09_implementation_status.md`
- Move completed items to `p_completed.md`
- Document any blockers or issues
- Update this file (claude.md-> "Next Steps" & "Project Status") once tasks are complete and once phases are complete so we can pick
up from where we left off in another session just in case

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS

### **Before Creating ANY File**
1. Check `updates/08_repository_structure.md`
2. Search for existing similar functionality
3. Enhance existing files rather than creating new ones

### **Known Duplicate Directories**
- `analytics/` exists in both root and `agents/`
- Use `agents/analytics/` for new analytics agents

### **Do NOT Skip**
- Reading complete phase specifications before implementation
- Verifying claimed completions against actual code
- Testing imports and functionality
- Updating progress tracking
