# PROJECT CONTEXT FOR CLAUDE
# Last updated: 2025-07-15 (‚úÖ Knowledge Tools Refactoring Complete, 6/7 Major Files Refactored)

## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is **MCP Yggdrasil** - a sophisticated hybrid knowledge server combining:
- **Neo4j** (knowledge graph) + **Qdrant** (vector search) + **Redis** (cache)
- **Six primary academic domains**: Art, Language, Mathematics, Philosophy (includes Religion), Science (includes Astrology), Technology
- **Yggdrasil tree structure**: Root = Main Categories/Subjects -> Branch = Subjects/fields within the main Categories/Fields -> Limb = Groups/Cultures/Civilizations, people,  place, ideas, etc. within particular branches -> Leaf = Individual works, texts, accomplishments,   doctrines, etc. -> 
Properties = Attributes, Qualities, Information, etc. or any important details about each individual node (Nodes are all things just mentioned, Groups, People, Ideas, Texts, Manuscripts, Categories, Fields, Subjects, etc. Everything in the Neo4j graph is considered a node unless it's a relationship) -> 
Relationships = Related nodes to some capacity eg. Father of, Mother of, Brother of, Sister of, etc. and Student of, Teacher of, Creator/Founder of, Inspired/Influenced by, etc. and for places here are some examples we can expand on, Birthplace of (person, religion, doctrine, idea, art style, language, etc), battle of, etc.
Please ask if you need clarity or ideas when it comes to creating and labeling nodes.
- **AI agents**: Text Processor, Web Scraper & Text Scraper,  Vector Indexer, Graph Manager, Data/Information analysis agents

### Agent Import Patterns & Dependencies
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Agent organization follows functional workflow:
```python
# Scraping Process Agents
from agents.scraper.scraper_agent import WebScraper
from agents.youtube_transcript.youtube_agent import YouTubeAgent
from agents.text_processor.text_processor import TextProcessor

# Data Analysis Agents  
from agents.analytics.anomaly_detector.anomaly_detector import AnomalyDetector
from agents.analytics.claim_analyzer.claim_analyzer import ClaimAnalyzer
from agents.analytics.concept_explorer.concept_explorer import ConceptExplorer
from agents.fact_verifier.enhanced_verification_agent import FactVerifier

# Database Management Agents
from agents.neo4j_manager.neo4j_agent import Neo4jAgent
from agents.qdrant_manager.qdrant_agent import QdrantAgent
from agents.sync_manager.sync_manager import SyncManager
from agents.knowledge_graph.knowledge_graph_builder import KnowledgeGraphBuilder
```

**Agent Workflow Dependencies**:
1. **Scraping ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Database**: Linear data flow
2. **Cross-functional**: Analytics agents can call database agents
3. **Modular**: Each agent group can operate independently

### CSV Knowledge Graph Data (CLEANED & PRODUCTION-READY)
- `CSV/` - **Main cleaned CSV structure** ready for Neo4j import:
  - Standard domains: `art/`, `language/`, `mathematics/`, `philosophy/`, `science/`, `technology/`
  - Subdomains: `philosophy/religion/`, `science/pseudoscience/astrology/`
  - `shared/` - Cross-domain data (places, time periods, relationships)
  - `import/` - Neo4j import scripts
  - `sources/` - Document metadata for Qdrant integration
  - `vectors/` - Neo4j‚ÜîQdrant sync metadata
- `scripts/csv_cleanup_script.py` - **Production-ready cleanup tool**
- `CSV_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - **Detailed cleanup results and metrics**

### Documentation
- `plan.md` - **UPDATED**: Comprehensive development plan with modular structure (active tasks only)
- `updates/` - **NEW**: Directory containing detailed implementation plans (e.g., `01_foundation_fixes.md`)
- `p_completed.md` - **NEW**: Completed tasks and implementations (moved from plan.md)
- `data_validation_pipeline_plan.md` - **NEW**: Multi-agent intelligent data validation plan
- `agents/claim_analyzer/claim_analyzer.md` - Fact-checking agent docs
- `final_readme.txt` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `CSV_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed data integration and cleanup results

### Refactoring Workflow Documentation
- `updates/refactoring/refactoring.md` - Document for refactoring rationale, plan, and process
- `updates/refactoring/streamlit_refactoring_summary.md` - Content scraper refactoring achievements and patterns
- `updates/refactoring/streamlit_backup_summary.md` - **UPDATED**: Comprehensive backup documentation
- **BACKUP FILES**: All original files preserved in `archive/` directory with .bak extension:
  - `01_database_manager_original.py.bak` through `08_processing_queue_original.py.bak`
  - `main_dashboard_original_backup.py.bak` and `main_dashboard_current.py.bak`
  - `network_analyzer.py.bak` and `trend_analyzer_original.py.bak`
  - **Total**: 11 complete original files preserved in centralized archive for safe refactoring

### Chat Logs & Session Management
- `chat_logs/` - **UPDATED**: Organized chat logs by date/time with action summaries
- `scripts/chat_logger.py` - **NEW**: Automated chat logging system with timestamps
- **RECENT LOGS**:
  - `2025-07-14_14-30_streamlit-dashboard-refactoring.md` - Dashboard refactoring session (386 lines)
  - `2025-07-15_09-15_streamlit-backup-and-continuation.md` - **NEW**: Backup creation and continuation session

#### Session Logging Protocol
1.  **New Session Start**: A new log file will be automatically created in the `chat_logs/` directory with the format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md`.
2.  **Real-time Logging**: The log will be updated with each message exchange and a summary of any actions I take (e.g., file modifications, commands run).
3.  **Session Summary**: A high-level summary of the session's achievements will be included at the top of the log file.
4.  **Audit Trail**: This process ensures a complete and transparent audit trail of all project development decisions and implementations.
5.  **Log Management**: Large logs (>700 lines) are split into focused sessions for better organization and readability.

### Project Planning & Progress
- `plan.md` - **ACTIVE**: Current and pending implementation tasks with modular structure
- `p_completed.md` - **NEW**: Archive of completed tasks and implementations
- `prompt.md` - **NEW**: Modular coding guidelines and best practices for implementation

### Refactoring Workflow
1.  **Backup**: Before refactoring a file, its original content is copied to `archive/` directory with .bak extension
2.  **Document**: The rationale, plan, and process for the refactoring is documented in `updates/refactoring/refactoring.md`. This includes the "what, how, and why" of the changes
3.  **Implement**: Only after documentation and backup will the refactoring of the code take place
4.  **Preserve**: All original functionality is maintained with centralized archive preservation system

# Note: Chat logs automatically created in chat_logs/ directory by date/time
```

## Agent Operational Guidelines
- **Pre-implementation Check**: Before implementing any steps, check the current project state to verify if the updates/steps have already been implemented.
- **Task Completion**: Mark completed tasks off the list in the plan.md file and the individual update files found in /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/MCP_Ygg/updates - update `p_completed.md` as appropriate. Analyze the `p_completed.md` file to make sure you are following the existing structure and not going off course.
