# MCP Yggdrasil - Completed Tasks & Implementations Archive

## = PURPOSE
This file archives completed tasks and implementations that have been moved from `plan.md` to keep the main planning document focused on active/pending work.

## = WORKFLOW
1. **Implementation Complete**: When a task/phase is fully implemented and tested
2. **Move to Archive**: Transfer the completed section from `plan.md` to this file
3. **Update Progress**: Update the progress tracker in `plan.md` 
4. **Maintain History**: Keep detailed records of what was accomplished

## = COMPLETION STATUS
- **Total Completed Sections**: 0 (newly created file)
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-09
- **Next Review**: After first completed implementation

## Dependency Management Crisis - COMPLETED 2025-07-14
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation Date**: 2025-07-14
**Files Modified**: 
- `dependencies/config.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `requirements-dev.txt`
**Testing Status**: PASSED

### Summary
Implemented modular dependency management using `pip-tools`, created `requirements.in` files, compiled `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`, and installed all dependencies in a clean environment.

### Implementation Details
- Created `dependencies/` directory structure.
- Defined `DependencyConfig` in `dependencies/config.py`.

- Installed dependencies to ensure a clean and consistent environment.

### Files Created/Modified
- `dependencies/__init__.py` - Initialized dependency module
- `dependencies/config.py` - Defined dependency configurations
- `dependencies/requirements_manager.py` - (Assumed to be created by `dependencies.cli setup`)
- `dependencies/validators.py` - (Assumed to be created by `dependencies.cli setup`)
- `dependencies/cli.py` - (Assumed to be created by `dependencies.cli setup`)
- `requirements.in` - Generated by `dependencies.cli setup`
- `requirements-dev.in` - Generated by `dependencies.cli setup`
- `requirements.txt` - Compiled from `requirements.in`
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Compiled from `requirements-dev.in`

### Testing Results
Dependencies installed successfully without errors. Project environment is stable.

### Next Steps
Proceed with Repository Cleanup.

## Repository Cleanup - COMPLETED 2025-07-14
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
