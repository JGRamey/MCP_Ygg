3. **Multi-source acquisition** with intelligent source discovery and prioritization
4. **Performance optimization** with concurrent processing and caching
5. **Academic and reference workflows** for specialized content acquisition

## Session 2 Progress (2025-07-16 | 21:40 - Ongoing)

### 📋 Session Objectives
- Review Phase 3 specification against actual implementation
- Identify and implement missing components
- Complete remaining Phase 3 requirements

### 🔍 Critical Discovery
Upon reviewing `/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/MCP_Ygg/updates/03_scraper_enhancement.md`, discovered that Phase 3 was **NOT actually complete**. Several key components from the specification were missing:

### ❌ Missing Components Identified:
1. **StructuredDataExtractor** - Advanced extruct integration for JSON-LD/microdata
2. **AdvancedLanguageDetector** - pycld3 integration with mixed language detection  
3. **Enhanced Anti-Detection** - fake-useragent and selenium-stealth integration
4. **Scraper Profiles** - Configurable profiles (fast, comprehensive, stealth, academic)

### 🎯 Next Session Priorities:
1. Complete anti-detection enhancements with selenium-stealth
2. Implement plugin architecture base classes
3. Integration testing of all components
4. Update documentation to reflect actual completion status

### 🚧 Technical Notes
- All new files created with comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

- Extensive logging and performance monitoring built-in
- Follows existing project patterns and architecture
- Profile-based configuration system for different use cases
