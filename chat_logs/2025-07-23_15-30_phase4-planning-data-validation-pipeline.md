   - Submission tracking
   - Status management

## Repository Structure Review
- Confirmed existing agents directory structure
- Identified need for new subdirectories:
  - `agents/content_analyzer/` (new)
  - `agents/fact_verifier/` (new)
  - `agents/quality_assessment/` (new)
  - `agents/knowledge_integration/` (new)
- Existing `data/staging/` structure already in place

## Implementation Plan

### Week 7 Tasks
1. [ ] Create intelligent scraper agent with content classification
2. [ ] Implement deep content analyzer with NLP pipeline
3. [ ] Build cross-reference engine with authoritative sources
4. [ ] Develop reliability scoring system
5. [ ] Enhance JSON staging workflow

### Week 8 Tasks
1. [ ] Deploy knowledge integration orchestrator
2. [ ] Implement Neo4j data preparation
3. [ ] Create Qdrant vector integration
4. [ ] Build provenance tracking system
5. [ ] Test end-to-end validation pipeline
6. [ ] Create manual review interface

## Success Metrics
- 80%+ content scoring >0.8 reliability
- <5% false positive rate
- >95% citation validation accuracy
- >90% claims cross-referenced
- <5 minutes processing per document
- <15% requiring manual review

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Modular Architecture**: Each agent <500 lines following Phase 3 patterns
2. **Async Processing**: Leverage existing Celery task queue from Phase 2
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle missing dependencies/services
4. **Academic Focus**: Prioritize scholarly sources and rigorous validation
5. **Event Node Type**: Add historical events to Neo4j schema

## Dependencies to Verify
- spaCy models (en_core_web_lg)
- Transformers pipelines

- pycld3 for language detection (already in Phase 3)
- aiohttp for async requests

## Next Steps
1. Create directory structure for new agents
2. Implement intelligent scraper agent first
3. Test with sample academic content
4. Build content analyzer with NLP pipeline
5. Integrate with existing Phase 3 scraper infrastructure
