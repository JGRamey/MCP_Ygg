### [20:35:00] JGR:
Remember that our domain count is only 6 because of moving Astrology(Branch) into science->pseudoscience(sub-domain) and then I moved Religion into Philosophy as a sub-domain. Other than that the app is looking great. We still need to improve someeeee things but this is a great start!

### [20:35:15] Claude:
*ACTION: Updated Graph Editor domain color mapping to reflect correct 6-domain structure*
*ACTION: Corrected domain configuration removing Religion and Astrology as separate domains*

You're absolutely right! 🎯 Thank you for that important correction. 

**Correct Domain Structure:**
1. **Art** 
2. **Language**
3. **Mathematics** 
4. **Philosophy** (with Religion as sub-domain)
5. **Science** (with Pseudoscience->Astrology as sub-domain)
6. **Technology**

Perfect! 🎉 I'm so glad you're happy with the workspace! You're absolutely right - this is a fantastic foundation that gives you a complete IDE-like environment for your MCP Yggdrasil project.
