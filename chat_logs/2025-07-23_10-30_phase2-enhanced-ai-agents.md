# MCP Yggdrasil - Session Log: Phase 2 Enhanced AI Agents
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Session Focus**: Phase 2 - Enhanced AI Agents Implementation  
**Project Week**: 1 of 12  
**Overall Progress**: 41%

## Session Objectives
Based on CLAUDE.md priorities:
1. Analyze staging_manager.py for refactoring needs
2. Implement Enhanced Claim Analyzer Agent (multi-source verification)
3. Implement Enhanced Text Processor Agent (multilingual support)
4. Implement Enhanced Vector Indexer Agent (dynamic models)
5. Complete Prometheus monitoring setup
6. Implement Celery async task queue

## Pre-Session Status
- Phase 1: 95% Complete (only minor documentation remaining)
- Phase 2: 30% Complete (missing enhanced AI agents, Celery, full monitoring)
- Phase 3: 85% Complete (missing plugin architecture, selenium-stealth)
- Overall: 41% of 12-week roadmap

## Session Progress

### Task 1: Project Analysis & Verification
- Read CLAUDE.md âœ“
- Created session log
- Ready to proceed with Phase 2 implementation

### Next Steps
1. Read plan.md for overview
2. Read updates/09_implementation_status.md for current progress
3. Read updates/02_performance_optimization.md for Phase 2 details
4. Create TODO list for session tasks
5. Begin implementation

## Complete Session Transcript

### Session Start
- Read claude.md to understand project context
- Confirmed Phase 2 Enhanced AI Agents as current priority
- Created TODO list for session tasks

### Task 3: Enhanced Text Processor Agent Implementation
1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Read existing text_processor.py (785 lines)
   - Reviewed Phase 2 requirements from updates/02_performance_optimization.md
   - Identified needed enhancements:
     - Multilingual support (12 languages)
     - Transformer integration
     - Entity linking to knowledge graph
     - Dynamic language detection

2. **Implementation**:
   - Created `/agents/text_processor/enhanced_text_processor.py` with:
     - ProcessedText and LinkedEntity dataclasses
     - EntityLinker class for knowledge graph integration
     - MultilingualProcessor with support for 12 languages
     - EnhancedTextProcessor main class with transformers
   - Created `/agents/text_processor/enhanced_config.yaml` configuration

3. **Key Features Implemented**:
   - **Languages**: EN, ES, FR, DE, IT, PT, NL, PL, RU, ZH, JA, AR
   - **Transformers**: BART (summarization), mT5 (multilingual), sentiment analysis, NER
   - **Entity Linking**: Links to Neo4j nodes (Person, Organization, Location, Concept)
   - **Advanced Features**: Concept extraction, key phrases, batch processing, caching

### File Management & Archiving
