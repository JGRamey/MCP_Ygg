TECH0001,Silurian_Hypothesis,branch,3,"A hypothesis by Adam Frank and Gavin Schmidt (2018) suggesting that evidence of ancient advanced civilizations might not survive due to geological processes, with potential clues like carbon or isotope spikes (e.g., Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum). Supports the idea that advanced civilizations could have existed long before modern humans, with evidence erased by time.",-65000000,Archaeological,Unknown,Various,Ancient technology example,speculative
TECH0002,"Abusir,_Egypt_(Drill_Holes)",branch,3,"Granite blocks at Abusir show precise drill holes and spiral grooves, suggesting advanced tools or techniques for ancient Egypt (circa 2500 BCE). Indicates potential lost technology, as such precision is difficult to explain with known ancient tools.",-2500,Archaeological,Egypt,Various,Ancient technology example,confirmed
TECH0003,"Puma_Punku,_Bolivia",branch,3,"Megalithic site with precisely cut andesite blocks (circa 600 CE, possibly older), featuring complex interlocking designs, suggesting advanced stonework. Some claim it dates to 15,000 years ago (Posnansky). Suggests a level of engineering sophistication that challenges conventional timelines, possibly hinting at a lost advanced culture.",600,Archaeological,Bolivia,Various,Ancient technology example,confirmed
TECH0004,"Göbekli_Tepe,_Turkey",branch,3,"A 12,000-year-old site with massive T-shaped pillars and animal carvings, built by hunter-gatherers, predating known agriculture and complex societies. Challenges the timeline of civilization, suggesting complex social organization and possibly advanced knowledge before farming.",-9600,Archaeological,Turkey,Various,Ancient technology example,confirmed
TECH0005,Antikythera_Mechanism,branch,3,"A Greek device (circa 150–100 BCE) with gears for tracking celestial movements, often called an ancient computer. Demonstrates unexpectedly advanced mechanical and astronomical knowledge, hinting at lost technological sophistication.",-100,Archaeological,Unknown,Various,Ancient technology example,confirmed
TECH0006,Roman_Concrete,branch,3,"Durable concrete used in structures like the Pantheon (circa 126 CE), with properties surpassing modern concrete in some ways. Suggests advanced material science that was lost for centuries, supporting the idea of forgotten technological achievements.",-753,Archaeological,Rome,Various,Ancient technology example,confirmed
